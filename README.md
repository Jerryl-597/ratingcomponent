## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vanilla JavaScript]

### What I learned

This was the first time I'll be using dataset in a project so it was really enervating. Also, this ws the shortest project I did - less than 3 hours. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Continued development

I hope to build more projects using the DOM.
